-----------------
new will allocate memory for the object 
new constructor will allocate some locati/on for an object and create it
object reference variable
constructor is a special method whose name is similar to class name
it is used to initialized varibles in class
constructor constructs the object
new keyword allocate memory for the object
hence new and constructor construct the object
we define object reference if we want to read object contents
if constructor is not present in a class then compiler adds the constructor
local variable must be initialized before its use
whenever function gives some value we should save that value in variable
