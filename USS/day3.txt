class is a block where we group variables and functions together;
if in c++ each variable is declared without using any access modifiers, then it becomes private variable;

function overloading means having multiple functions with same name but different argument;

it is called compile time polymorphism as compiler binds method call to method definition based on argument;

it is static binding/early binding as compiler binds method call to method definition based on arguments;

inheritance: it is the process by which parent class members, gets available to child class members;
when we create child class object, we should initialize variables of parents and child both;
hence parent class constructor should be called from child class constructor; (implicitely/explicitely)

private members are not inherited
